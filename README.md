# Background
This is a ride-sharing web application that enables users to request rides and connects them with nearby drivers. The app is built using a microservices architecture, consisting of three distinct microservices, each backed by a different database: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Neo4j. An API Gateway facilitates communication between the frontend and these microservices.

### Environment Setup

- Java: JDK/JRE Version 16.0.1
